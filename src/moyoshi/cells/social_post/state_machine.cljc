  "Phase state machine for the moyoshi social_post cell — the publication membrane that
  lets the actor self-publish observations to the mesh/AT-proto WITHOUT a server-held key.
  ADR-2606272355 (actor self-publication seed). Auto-seeded R0 (mirrors
  danjo.cells.social-post.state-machine / keizu's social_post membrane).

  A record enters; it is DRAFTED into a dry-run post ONLY if:

    source-provenance — \u2265 2 citations are present;
    non-adjudicating — the post is a mirror, opening with the observational disclaimer;
    no-server-key — server-held-key is false;
    R0-gate — the status is dry-run (a 'published' request REFUSES).

  Self-contained. Stdlib only. Deterministic."
