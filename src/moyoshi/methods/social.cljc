  "social.cljc — moyoshi DRY-RUN self-publication seed (ADR-2606272355, auto-seeded R0).

  This is a GENERIC self-publication projection (draft-observation-post below builds an
  app.bsky.feed.post-shaped record), mechanically derived from moyoshi's own
  manifest (:actor/purpose). It is an R0 SEED, not a bespoke domain projection (contrast
  danjo/keizu/monosashi, which hand-author their own draft-*-post shapes) — a future actor
  evolution pass MAY replace draft-observation-post with domain-specific post types, same as
  danjo did for its tax-revenue-ledger domain. Until then this seed satisfies the same
  invariants every sibling social_post membrane enforces:

    non-adjudicating mirror — every post opens with the observational disclaimer; narrates,
      never asserts a verdict.
    source-provenance — a post needs ≥2 cited sources (mirrors the common G5-class gate).
    no-server-key — :post/server-held-key is always false; the actor would self-custody its
      own key in its actor mesh runtime (ADR-2605231525), never a server-held key.
    R0-gate — status is 'dry-run' only; a live post needs Council Lv6+ + operator + a
      member/actor signature (build-live raises unconditionally at R0).

  Pure fns; deterministic; string-keyed post records (house style). Stdlib only."
